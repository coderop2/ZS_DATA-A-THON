# ZS_DATA-A-THON

This github repository contains all the code, presentation and the submission file for the Online and the Offline competition that was held by ZS.

**_Online challenge_** included a Time-Series forecast problem with a presentation or the explanation as to why that particular approach.

_**Offline challenge**_ was the hard and most particular kind of problem that can be found in competitions-the problem was to predict the NA(missing) values of 8 particular columns and a single row can have multiple missing values(there was no row that had all the values).
